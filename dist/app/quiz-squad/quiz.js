            "A form of cybercrime involving theft of online banking credentials.",
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        explanation: 'Money laundering is the process by which criminals conceal the true origin and ownership of the proceeds of their criminal activities, making the "dirty" money appear legitimate. It generally involves multiple steps or transactions intended to obscure the audit trail and sever the link between the funds and their illicit source. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because they describe tax evasion, routine banking activity, fraud, or cyber-theft rather than the definition of money laundering itself.',

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "The traditional three stages of money laundering are Placement, Layering, and Integration. Placement is the introduction of illicit funds into the financial system.

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: "While the placement-layering-integration model is a useful conceptual tool, in reality many money laundering schemes do not neatly follow these stages in strict order. Some stages may be skipped, repeated, or blended together. Therefore, it’s correct to say many modern schemes diverge from the simplistic linear model.",
